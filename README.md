# 🎨 Colorist

Welcome to **Colorist** — a vibrant Flutter project designed to help you explore and play with colors, powered by Google Gemini and Vertex AI! 🌈

## 🚀 Project Overview
Colorist is an interactive app where you can experiment with color palettes, get AI-powered suggestions, and learn about color theory. Inspired by the [Flutter Gemini Colorist Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-gemini-colorist#0).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd colorist
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Make sure you have the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/) installed.
   - If you get stuck at `flutterfire configure`, you can run it manually:
     ```powershell
     & "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin\flutterfire.bat" configure
     ```
4. **Upgrade to Blaze Plan:**
   - To access Vertex AI services, upgrade your Firebase project to the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan.

5. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 💡 Tips & Notes
- If you encounter issues with `flutterfire configure`, try running the manual command above.
- Make sure your Google Cloud project has Vertex AI enabled.
- Explore the [official codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-gemini-colorist#0) for step-by-step guidance.
